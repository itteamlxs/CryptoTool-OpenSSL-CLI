# üîê CryptoTool - OpenSSL Automation Toolkit

Welcome to **CryptoTool**, your easy-to-use automation toolkit for **OpenSSL** ‚Äî designed to simplify cryptographic tasks on Linux and Windows.

## What is OpenSSL?

OpenSSL is the most widely used open-source toolkit for implementing the **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)** and **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** protocols, which secure communications on the internet. It also provides powerful cryptographic functions like:

- Symmetric encryption (AES, DES, etc.)
- Asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECC)
- Digital certificates and signing
- Hashing (SHA, MD5, etc.)
- Key and certificate management

OpenSSL is a fundamental tool for securing data, authenticating identities, and ensuring privacy in countless applications worldwide.

## Why automate OpenSSL?

While OpenSSL is powerful, its command-line interface can be complex and verbose, especially for repetitive tasks. Automating OpenSSL commands with scripts helps:

- Reduce human errors
- Speed up workflows
- Simplify cryptography for learners and professionals
- Provide a consistent, user-friendly interface across platforms

This project bundles easy-to-use scripts for Linux and Windows that cover common OpenSSL operations such as encrypting files, generating keys, creating certificates, signing data, and more.
